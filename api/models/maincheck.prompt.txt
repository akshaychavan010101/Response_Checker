####Question: I have lot of confusion going in my head. My son is 6yr old. He is happy to go to school. We have put him to a Montessori school of 10yr old. My son isn't learning enough for 1st grade. He is learning languages well but not Maths. Should I change school and put him to regular school or continue. I am in a fear of not getting seat in other school as years pass, so I want to do it this year. What is your opinion. Kindly let me know.
```Answer 1: This question is best asked to the teacher or founder of school. Because in Montessori children can learn at their own pace so it is possible when he starts taking interest in maths he will do 2 years of maths in 3 months. But it is imp that the Montessori school is right.Also see Aavishkaar. They learn online course for parents to learn mathematics. You can learn the first grade math and spend some time with your son if you might wish to :-).

Answer 2: Namaste! It's great to see your dedication to your child's education. Choosing the right school for your child can be a tough decision, but remember, every child learns differently. Montessori schools focus more on holistic development, including language skills. If your son is excelling in languages but needs improvement in math, it might be a good idea to continue for now. Here's what you can do: 1. Talk to your son's teacher about his progress in math and share your concerns. They can provide guidance and suggest strategies to improve his skills. 2. Supplement his learning at home by emphasizing math through fun activities, like playing games or using everyday objects to teach concepts.

Question: My daughter is 19 mnths. But jab usko me koi chij nai deti hu ya uski koi zid Puri nai kti hu tou wo mujhe hit karti haiShe is just 19 mnths..how can I control this behaviourYa kabhi kabhi wo masti me b mujhe hit kar deti hai.
I tell her hitting noo..nd wo khud b bolti hai hitting nooo..but not regularly..but spcly wen i don't listen to her
```Answer 1: Meherr ji - sorry for the late reply. Aapki beti choti hai. Is umar mein kuch na milne pe kaise behave karna hai bachon ko pata nahin hota. Emotion pe kaabu nahin hota. Lekin bachon ka bhi maarna rok sakte hai. Thoda time laga ke.
Kabhi bhi jiss cheez ke liye bacha hit kar raha hai woh puri nahin karni kyonki phir bachey ko lagta hai ke maarne se cheez milegi. So a no means a no. But pyaar se.
Aap calm aawaaz mein usko bol sakti hai - No using hands and feet. Mujhe lagti hai. Same line hi humein baar baar use karni hai.
Phir Aap uski feeling ko acknowledge karo. Ke aapko woh chahiye. Haan? Mujhe pata hai. Mujhe pata hai aapko aacha lagta hai. Lekin maarne se kabhi nahin milega. Mummy loves you. 
Bachon ke nervous system ko touch karne se calmnes milti hai. Unko touch karke pyaar se mana karenge to baat samajne ka chance zyada hai.
Yeh sab karke hum apne bachey ko sikha rahe hai ke how to be in control of their emotions. Yeh imp learning sabse pehle maa baap se hi aati hai :-)
Lots of love to your family.

Answer 2: Aapki beti, sirf 19 mahine ki, aapko hit karti hai, toh pareshan hona samajh mein aata hai. Uske haath pakadkar pyaar se kahiye, 'Hum haath nahi lagate, yeh acchi baat nahi hai.' Positive behavior ko encourage karein jab woh 'hitting no' bolti hai ya haath nahi lagati. Dekhein ki hitting ki wajah kya hai, aur usse samajhne aur acche tarike se express karne ke liye prerit karein. Dhire-dhire process hai, pyaar aur sabr se uski guidance karein. Aap iss mushkil samay se nipat sakte hain!

Answer 3: "It's understandable that dealing with aggressive behavior from a young child can be challenging. At 19 months, toddlers are still learning how to express themselves and regulate their emotions. Here are some strategies you can try to address your daughter's hitting behavior:
Remain calm: When your daughter hits you, try your best to stay calm and composed. Reacting strongly might reinforce the behavior as it can get her attention.
Set clear boundaries: Make sure your daughter understands that hitting is not acceptable behavior. Use simple language and firm but gentle tone to tell her ""No hitting. Hitting hurts.""
Offer alternatives: Teach her appropriate ways to express her feelings, such as using words to communicate her needs or frustrations. Encourage her to say ""I'm angry"" or ""I'm upset"" when she's feeling that way.
Be consistent: Consistently enforce the ""no hitting"" rule. Children learn through repetition, so it's important to consistently respond to her hitting behavior each time it occurs.

Main isko kaise thik kru??"
```Answer 1:"Rajpriya ji, yeh sirf aap chot lagne par bol rahi hai ya in general bhi agar dukhi lag rahi hai to baat nahin karti 
Aapko kyon lagta hai ke aapki beti dukhi hai?
Rajpriya ji, the environment in your house is impacting your child. Ghar ke badao ke karan bache parr asar pad gaya haiAgar bade landenge ya bachey ko alag alag cheez bolenge ya daantenge to bacha apni feelings dabana shuru ho jayega. Human's ke dimaag ka ek simple udeshya hai - bachey ko safe feel karwana
Agar usko safe feel nahin hota, calm nahin feel hota, to woh dheere develop hota hai. Sochiye ke aap pareshaan hai. Jabb hum pareshaan hote hai to kaam pe focus nahin kar paate aur dukhi rehte haiwahi apki beti ke saath ho sakta haihttps://www.instagram.com/p/Co7CvllIXwy/Joint family mein agar bade sab same page pe ho, to bachey ke liye best hai Aap do teen cheezein kar sakti hai- apni beti ke saath bahar walks pe ja sakti hai, taaki aap dono ko akele aacha simple time mile- aapke husband bhi yeh kar sakte hai uske saath- aap apna relationship apne husband aur inlaws ke saath improve kar sakti hai taaki ghar mein ladayi nahin ho. Unko bata sakti hai ke yeh hamare bachey ke liye zaroori hai"

Answer 2:Harpreet ji, aapki baat samajh gayi. Aapki beti ke vyavahar mein kuch anormal nazar aa raha hai. Ye ho sakta hai ki kuch wajah se wo apne emotions dikha nahi rahi hai aur aapko lagta ho ki wo dukhi hai. Isse jyada clarity ke liye, ek professional se consult karna sahi hoga. Aap apni beti ke behavior par dhyan rakhe, lekin samjhane ki koshish kare ki wo apne dard aur emotions ko share kare. Aap usse pyaar se baat kare aur uska vishwas jeete. Ek family counselor ki madad se aap apne in-law arguments ko bhi handle kar sakte hai. Capsule thaap (therapy) aapki situation mein madad karega.

Answer 3:Rinki ji, aapke saath main aapki samasya samajh rahi hu. Aapki beti ki vyavahar aur uske emotions se relate karte huye, ye normal ho sakta hai. Kuch bacche aise hote hai jo apne emotions ko bahar nahi dikhate, par ye matlab nahi hai ki unhe kuch nahi hota. Shayad aapki beti bahut sensitive hai aur apne aap ko control karne ki koshish karti hai. Aap ek mamta se, pyaar se apne bacche ke emotions ki baat kare. Uske emotions ko samjhne ka prayaas kare. Dhire dhire, usse bataaye ki emotions ko vyakt karne mein koi galat nahi hai. Aur jab wo dukhi hoti hai ya apne haq se pareshaan hoti ha

Question:"Hi i m mother of 7 yrs old girl....just few days back I was started follow ur page. ...as I see u shared parenting hood tips....bt i want to share with u about my daughter she is 7 yrs old she is hyper active child.....as I live in joint family so she is pampering child also....bt because of over pamper Ness she is never listen to me even a single tym...i do many tyms repeatations. And at last I feel anger or sme tyms fed-up .....as I consult with doctor past 2 yrs back about her so doctor said she is having ADHD problem.....Sometimes I dnt understand stand to .....teach them her gud nd bads...... because of over pampering makes her ziddi type bacha.....she is never ready to listen me.....plz share ur some valuable tips nd tricks hw i deal with herScreen time is in whole day only one hour
Because of cold weather she is playing only indoor games......
Nd part of pampering in u cn say that like said anything to her for good or i m not allowed her for something so she will go to her grandparents and said to them muma mana kr rhi hai"
```Answer 1:"Avneet ji - saw your message.
- how much screen time does she get
- how much time with nature outdoors does she get
- when you say pampered in joint family can you explain this?
Avneet looks like the main thing you have to work on is not the child
But your relationship with other elders in the house
Because what is imp is that all the adults are on the same page
Otherwise the child will take advantage
This can be hard but that is the one solution if you want the best for your child.
Avneet - this does look like a situation where you could take help of a counsellor/doctor also. So please do. TheFamilytree in Delhi is one good place I know. Also time outside is critical , with nature. For the child. If you can spend that with your child, that would help"

Answer 2:Namaste! Aapka bahut swagat hai! Aapne bahut achhe se apni beti ki zidd aur hyperactivity ke baare mein samjhaya hai. Main samajh sakta hoon ki joint family mein rehne se aapko kabhi kabhi mushkil ho sakti hai apni baat samjhaane mein. Par aap chinta mat kijiye, main aapki help karunga. Sabse pehle, ADHD ek kuch common problem hai. Aise mein vichaar karna jaruri hai ki aap apni beti ko physical activities aur outdoor games ke bare mein encourage kijiye. Even agar ghar pe khelna hai toh bhi energizing games jaise ki running race yaaye lagana bade room ke piche aur tab tak hum count karenge ya Aap uski kadarin banaw kar ashur anchal pakadaye
